# 🕷️ WebSpider

## Why?

Have you ever wanted to crawl an entire website and generate a comprehensive report? Introducing WebSpider, a powerful web crawler that allows you to traverse a website, collect data from each page, and generate insightful reports.

I faced the challenge of efficiently gathering information from websites, and existing solutions fell short. That's why I built WebSpider—to provide a seamless and customizable solution for crawling websites and extracting valuable data.
